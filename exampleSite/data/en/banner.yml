  title: CO2 Capture Device thru Voltage Oscillations in Bio based Material
  content: 'The concept of electro-swing adsorption by quinone is feasible and sustainable
    technology as this material can be reused and would be cost effective as compared
    to the existing technologies of carbon capturing. Proposed research  is based
    on a sustainable natural polymer and primarily focuses on the application of this
    technology in automobiles which later could be extended to industrial exhaust
    systems. '
